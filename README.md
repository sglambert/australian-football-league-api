# Australian-Football-League-API
The Australian-Football-League-API (AFL-API) provides a free and simple way to retrieve AFL data from various sources.

For more information, please see the [documentation](https://australian-football-league-api.herokuapp.com/api/docs).

### Built with
- Python
- Flask
- Docker

## Getting Started

### Usage

The API can be used to retrieve 6 different types of data, including: ```fixture, ladder, lineup, player details, player statistics``` and ```results```.


The following examples (below) display how to get data from the ```fixture``` API endpoint. In both instances the returned object will be JSON.

|Request|Python|
--- | --- |

```
import requests

response = requests.request(
    'GET',
    'https://australian-football-league-api.herokuapp.com/fixture',
    params={
        'season': 2022,
        'round_number': 1,
        'source': 'AFL',
        'competition': 'AFLM'
    }
)
```

|Request|cURL|
--- | --- |

```
curl -X GET "https://australian-football-league-api.herokuapp.com/fixture?season=2022&round_number=1&source=AFL&competition=AFLM" -H "accept: application/json"
```

The [documentation](https://australian-football-league-api.herokuapp.com/api/docs) provides further information and examples on how to retrieve data from the API.

### Testing & Building Locally

#### Tests

To run tests in the ```tests/``` directory we'll need to setup a virtual environment in the project root directory.

To do this, open up a terminal in the proejct root and execute the following command:

``` python3 -m venv venv ```

Then activate the virtual environment:

``` source venv/bin/activate ```

Finally, install dependencies in the virtual environment:

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

The virtual environment has been activated and all dependencies installed in it. Tests can now be run by executing the following command in the project root directory:

``` python -m pytest tests -vv -s ```

#### Build

To build the image locally execute the following commands in the project root directory:

```docker build -t afl-api .```

```docker run -it -p 5000:5000 afl-api```

The following resources will then available on your local machine:

Localhost home page: ```http://127.0.0.1:5000```

Localhost API docs: ```http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/docs```
